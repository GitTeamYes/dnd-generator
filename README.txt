==Description of Software==
This is a D&D Random Character Generator.  Given some set constants (or none at
all) it will go ahead and generate the rest of a player character for you.  The
original goal in conceiving this software was to put together a generator that
would help a rushed DM create fleshed out high level NPCs for player characters
to encounter.

The generator though is equally useful for those that need to quickly roll up a
character in order to join a game, or for those that do not care about some or
all of the details of their character.  The generator is designed so that you
can fill in the details that you care about and let it fill in the rest.
