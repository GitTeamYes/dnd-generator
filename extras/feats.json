//	if its a base bonus, that skill, stats, or skill level is shown and incremented
//	if its a combat ability that is given, then it is listed as a string that is added to a combat options string
//	all others are misc
//archtype: the types of classes that would take this feat
//	suggested that we make a file that is used by the AI to determine what feats should be used
